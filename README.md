# Kindle Guard

The absolute moron(s) who designed my Kindle decided to, for whatever freaking reason, put the power button on the BOTTOM of the device. This meant that whenever I tried to prop it upright, it would restart. This was absolutely infuriating because it meant my Kindle was entirely unusable on the elliptical and pretty much all the other times I'd want to use it. 

So I 3D printed a thing to place over the bottom so that the button could not be accidentally pressed, but had an opening to do so if needed.
